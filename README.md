Hello all! The goal of this assignment was to use Visual Studio Code to clean raw data and allow it to be used. 
The data folder consists of the raw data in one folder, and clean data in another.
The src folder shows the code that was used to clean the data. Copilot helped me complete this task.
The reflection section is a 3 paragraph reflection on how this project went.
